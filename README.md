Welcome!!

The files contained within are being built as a practice project
for learning Python programming, and to practice general 
programming habits and develop skills and familiarity with these systems.

In lieu of a serious project on which to build my skills, I have elected
to create some basic video games in order to practice coding, project
management, and general game design.

CarPG is a text-based adventure game based on Oregon Trail.

RPGF is a text-based RPG adventure game based on old-school
Text-Based games and, consequently, inspired by Dungeons and Dragons.

RPGF also contains some functions and data used by CarPG, such as
a list of names, team names, and a color class for coloring text.


Enjoy!  And please don't hesitate to throw some pointer or tips my way!
